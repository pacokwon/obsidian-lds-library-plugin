# Quickstart

## Requirements

You only need Obsidian installed!

## Installation

### Community Plugin

This plugin can be found from the list of community plugins for Obsidian. Open Obsidian's Settings -> Community Plugins, and click `Browse` to search this plugin's name and install.

### Manual Installation

The plugin can also be manually installed by:

1. Creating a directory called `lds-library-plugin` under `.obsidian/plugins/` within your vault.
2. From this plugin's [Releases Page](https://github.com/pacokwon/obsidian-lds-library-plugin/releases), download and put `main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css` into `.obsidian/plugins/lds-library-reference/`.
3. Reload Obsidian and navigate to the `Community Plugins` tab to see that installation is successful.
4. Ensure the plugin is then enabled.

# Features

## Multiple Scripture Support

The [standard works](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/standard-works?lang=eng), or the volumes of scripture officially accepted by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are available.

- Holy Bible (King James Version)
- Book of Mormon
- Doctrine and Covenants
- Pearl of Great Price

### How To Reference Verses

Insert a callout to a verse using either `:<Book Name> <Chapter Number>:<Verse Numbers>:` or `:<Book Name> <Chapter Number> <Verse Numbers>:`.

You can referece any range, selection, or series of verses from a given chapter using the above syntax.

Obsidian won’t recognize your desired reference until you add a : at the end. Each reference must be on its own line.

Only English book titles are recognized. For example `:1 Nephi 1 1:` is recognized, but `:1 Нефи 1:1:` isn't.

Refer to [BOOKS.md](https://github.com/pacokwon/obsidian-lds-library-plugin/blob/main/docs/BOOKS.md) for the complete list of book names used and recognized in this plugin.

## General Conference Support

### How To Quote General Conference

Get started with inserting a General Conference quote using `:<Month Name> <Year Number>:`, which will open a Conference Picker prompt.

![Conference Talk Picker Prompt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26873f4a-3e4f-4675-9dd1-36d913c9f84f)

After accepting the suggestion, one can search for and choose a talk from that conference.

![Conference Talk Picker](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aead481d-19c7-4042-941e-33e6e4044307)

Choose the paragraphs you would like to quote by clicking on them individually, and press `Create Link` to insert the quote in a callout.

## Multiple Language Support

### Default Language
The default language used for scriptures and conference talks can be set in the Settings tab of the plugin.

![Settings](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b25e58b8-39ef-44ab-9966-0e0590262881)

### One-time Language Syntax
For both verses and conference quotes, optionally specify the language for the reference by appending `[<lang>]` at the front. If the language isn't specified, the default language will be used.
